From The Odin Project's [curriculum](http://www.theodinproject.com/courses/web-development-101/lessons/html-css)

In this project I recreate the google search homepage (the visual aspect of it and some links).
This project serves as a way to practice the skills learned on the basic web development course of The Odin Project.
As the project is a basic starter project, it shouldn't be detailed, and the visuals are just similar to those of google's search homepage.

For an online preview go to: https://fedehr.github.io/google-homepage/
