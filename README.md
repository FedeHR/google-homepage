In this project I try to recreate the google search homepage (only the visual aspect of it).
This project serves as a way to practice the skills learned on the basic web development course of The Odin Project.
As the project is a basic starter project, it shouldn't be detailed, and the visuals are just similar to those of google's search homepage.
